# Todo-Node
Made a simple To-Do application while learning Node.js

This To-do web application allows you to quickly add and remove items.



## Running the application: 
1) Clone the repository
2) Install `node.js`
3) Open terminal in the downloaded folder
4) Run `node app.js`

The application will run at `127.0.0.1/3000/todo` by default. You can change the port/route by modifying the
appropriate lines in `app.js` and the `todo-controller` file.
